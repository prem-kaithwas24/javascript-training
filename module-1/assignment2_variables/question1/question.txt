1. Declare a variable-let a;. On another line assign any value you like to a. Log the value of a before and after assignment.
 Try doing the same with const.

################-----------ANSWER-----------##############
When I declared a variable with let and assigned a value later, it worked fine. However, when I tried the same with const, I got the following error:
"Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration."
Got it, const variables must be initialized at the time of declaration.
