2. Where to attach the script tag:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1 id="test">Hello World!</h1>

</body>
</html>

Given the above html, find out what happens when you try to access the element h1 in
javascript (using document.getElementById) and change its content to “Goodbye World”
when the script is attached:
● in the head tag
● at the start of the body tag
● at the end of the body tag

################-----------ANSWER-----------##############
1. When script is in head tag.
  :- The script loads before the <h1> tag is added to the DOM, resulting in an Uncaught TypeError. This is because browser will run the script tag as soon as it encounters it.

2. When script is at the start of the body tag.
  :- The script loads before the <h1> tag is added to the DOM, resulting in an Uncaught TypeError. This is because browser will run the script tag as soon as it encounters it.

3. When script is at the end of the body tag.
  :- The script worked because the target <h1> tag was already added to the DOM before the browser encountered the script tag.
